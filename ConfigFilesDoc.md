# DeepLenstronomy Configuration Files

An overview of how to structure the main configuration file for `deeplenstronomy`.

## Introduction

The purpose of `deeplenstronomy` is to wrap the strong-lensing image simulation utilities of `lenstronomy` into a convenient and reproducible framework.
This is achieved in `deeplenstronomy` by enabling the user to generate an entire large-scale dataset from a single, human-readable configuration file.

This tutorial will help you to create the main configuration file for problem you are working on.

## Sections in the Config File

The main configuration file for `deeplenstronomy` is a yaml-style document.
The top-level keywords in this document will tell `deeplenstronomy` everything it needs to know to build you a dataset. These keywords are **mandatory** for `deeplenstronomy` to function properly.

### The DATASET Section

This section will contain information regarding the dataset as a whole, rather than the individual images or systems you want to generate. 
Here you must specify the `NAME` and `SIZE` of the dataset. 
If you plan on saving the dataset, you must also specify the `OUTDIR` where you want the simulated images and associated metadata to be located.
This is done with a block like this

```
DATASET:
    NAME: MyDeeplenstronomyDataset
    PARAMETERS:
        SIZE: 100
        OUTDIR: MySimulationResults
```
This block will set the name of the dataset to `MyDeeplenstronomyDataset`, specify that the dataset will contain 100 images, and specify that the simulated images and associated metadata will be saved in a directory named `MySimulationResults`. 
If this directory does not already exist on your system, `deeplenstronomy` will create it automatically.

### The COSMOLOGY Section

This section will specify the cosmology with which `lenstronomy` will perform all calculations. In the config file, the bare-minimum cosmology section would look like this

```
COSMOLOGY:
    PARAMETERS:
        H0: 70
        Om0: 0.3
```
Internally, all that happens within `deeplenstronomy` is the instantiation of an `astropy.cosmology.FlatLambdaCDM` object. Thus, you can specify the value of `H0`, `Om0`, `Tcmb0`, `Neff`, `m_nu`, and `Ob0`. You can also view the [astropy documentation](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.cosmology.FlatLambdaCDM.html#flatlambdacdm) for more information on these parameters.

### The IMAGE Section

This section will specify all the information needed to make simulated images look realistic. The following parameters are required for `deeplenstronomy` to generate images:

- `exposure_time`: the number of seconds used to capture the image
- `numPix`: the width of the images in pixels
- `pixel_scale`: the number of arcseconds in each pixel
- `psf_type`: describes the model for the point-spread-function of the instrument
- `read_noise`: standard deviation of noise generated by read-out (in units of electrons)
- `ccd_gain`: the number of photo-electrons required for each analog-to-digital unit

A typical `IMAGE` block will look like this

```
IMAGE:
	PARAMETERS:
	    exposure_time: 90
	    numPix: 100
	    pixel_scale: 0.263
	    psf_type: 'GAUSSIAN'
	    read_noise: 7
	    ccd_gain: 6.083
```

### The SURVEY Section

This section specifies the properties of the survey that collected the dataset you are seeking to simulate. This could be DES, LSST, SDSS, ZTF, etc. The parameters `deeplenstronomy` needs in this section are:

- `BANDS`: a comma-separated list of the optical filters used
- `seeing`: the FWHM in arcseconds of the measured PSF from the observations
- `magnitude_zero_point`: the magnitude at which one photo-electron is measured each second
- `sky_brightness`: measured light contamination from the atmosphere in magnitudes per square arcsecond
- `num_exposures`: the number of individual exposures in each coadded image

Thus, an example `SURVEY` block could look like this

```
SURVEY:
	PARAMETERS:
	    BANDS: g,r,i,z,Y
	    seeing: 0.9
	    magnitude_zero_point: 30.0
	    sky_brightness: 27.5
	    num_exposures: 10
```

### Half-Way-There Summary

Just to recap what we've talked about, let's put everything together. So far, we've covered the top-level aspects of the simulation: the properties of the dataset, the cosmological model for calculations, the image properties, and the survey conditions. Our in-progress config file currently looks like this:

```
DATASET:
    NAME: MyDeeplenstronomyDataset
    PARAMETERS:
        SIZE: 100
        OUTDIR: MySimulationResults

COSMOLOGY:
    PARAMETERS:
        H0: 70
        Om0: 0.3

IMAGE:
	PARAMETERS:
	    exposure_time: 90
	    numPix: 100
	    pixel_scale: 0.263
	    psf_type: 'GAUSSIAN'
	    read_noise: 7
	    ccd_gain: 6.083

SURVEY:
	PARAMETERS:
	    BANDS: g,r,i,z,Y
	    seeing: 0.9
	    magnitude_zero_point: 30.0
	    sky_brightness: 27.5
	    num_exposures: 10
```

Next, we'll look at how to specify the properties of the physical objects in the images as well as the geometry of the strong-lensing systems you're interested in.

### The SPECIES Section

This section specifies the properties of each object or noise source that could potentially be in one of your images. 
There are currently three species of object supported in `deeplenstronomy`: `GALAXY`, `POINTSOURCE`, and `NOISE`. The most information rich species is `GALAXY`, so let's start there.

**GALAXY.**
This species has up to 5 attributes for which you can provide information. 
The first of these is the `NAME` keyword, which `deeplenstronomy` will use internally to group the properties of the object. Thus, the `NAME` attribute is mandatory. 
The next three attributes (light profiles, mass profiles, and shear profiles) are the core of the `lenstronomy ` simulation.

Light profiles are specified with the `LIGHT_PROFILE_X` keyword and describe how light is distributed around the object.
The `X` represents an index to differentiate multiple light profiles in the case where you would like to utilize a superposition of profiles.
The available profiles are any that are available in `lenstronomy`, and you can look at the `lenstronomy` documentation to see all the options and associated parameters.

As an example, let's create a `GALAXY` species that we'll name "LENS" with a "SERSIC_ELLIPSE" light profile.

```
SPECIES:
    GALAXY_1:
        NAME: LENS
        LIGHT_PROFILE_1:
            NAME: SERSIC_ELLIPSE
            PARAMETERS:
                magnitude: 19.5
                center_x: 0.0
                center_y: 0.0
                R_sersic: 10
                n_sersic: 4
                e1: 0.2
                e2: -0.1
```

The parameters you need to specify will depend on the `lenstronomy` light profile you select, so check the `lenstronomy` documentation for what parameters you need. 
If we wanted to add a second light profile to this `GALAXY`, perhaps to add more light in the center, we can do so by adding a second section like this:

```
SPECIES:
    GALAXY_1:
        NAME: LENS
        LIGHT_PROFILE_1:
            NAME: SERSIC_ELLIPSE
            PARAMETERS:
                magnitude: 19.5
                center_x: 0.0
                center_y: 0.0
                R_sersic: 10
                n_sersic: 4
                e1: 0.2
                e2: -0.1
        LIGHT_PROFILE_2:
            NAME: SERSIC_ELLIPSE
            PARAMETERS:
                magnitude: 18.0
                center_x: 0.0
                center_y: 0.0
                R_sersic: 3
                n_sersic: 8
                e1: 0.05
                e2: -0.05
```

The next bit of information `lenstronomy` needs to calculate how light is lensed is the mass distibution.
Since we have conveniently named this `GALAXY` "LENS", it's not too farfetched to image that it will act as the lensing galaxy when this is all said and done, so we'll give it what `deeplenstronomy` calls a mass profile.

Mass profiles will also draw directly from the `lenstronomy` allowed models, so check the `lenstronomy` documentation for all your options. In `deeplenstronomy`, you will adopt the same indexing scheme as the light profiles. Let's add a mass profile to "LENS".

```
SPECIES:
    GALAXY_1:
        NAME: LENS
        LIGHT_PROFILE_1:
            NAME: SERSIC_ELLIPSE
            PARAMETERS:
                magnitude: 19.5
                center_x: 0.0
                center_y: 0.0
                R_sersic: 10
                n_sersic: 4
                e1: 0.2
                e2: -0.1
        LIGHT_PROFILE_2:
            NAME: SERSIC_ELLIPSE
            PARAMETERS:
                magnitude: 18.0
                center_x: 0.0
                center_y: 0.0
                R_sersic: 3
                n_sersic: 8
                e1: 0.05
                e2: -0.05
        MASS_PROFILE_1:
            NAME: SIE 
            PARAMETERS:
                theta_E: 2.0
                e1: 0.1
                e2: -0.1
                center_x: 0.0
                center_y: 0.0
```

Here we've used `lenstronomy`'s "SIE" model and specified the necessary parameters for it. 
Let's finish up describing "LENS" by giving it a shear profile.
A shear profile describes how _all_ the light in the system is lensed by an external source, perhaps a dark matter halo.
You can add this type of profile to "LENS" as follows:

```
SPECIES:
    GALAXY_1:
        NAME: LENS
        LIGHT_PROFILE_1:
            NAME: SERSIC_ELLIPSE
            PARAMETERS:
                magnitude: 19.5
                center_x: 0.0
                center_y: 0.0
                R_sersic: 10
                n_sersic: 4
                e1: 0.2
                e2: -0.1
        LIGHT_PROFILE_2:
            NAME: SERSIC_ELLIPSE
            PARAMETERS:
                magnitude: 18.0
                center_x: 0.0
                center_y: 0.0
                R_sersic: 3
                n_sersic: 8
                e1: 0.05
                e2: -0.05
        MASS_PROFILE_1:
            NAME: SIE 
            PARAMETERS:
                theta_E: 2.0
                e1: 0.1
                e2: -0.1
                center_x: 0.0
                center_y: 0.0
        SHEAR_PROFILE_1:
            NAME: SHEAR
            PARAMETERS:
                gamma1: 0.08
                gamma2: 0.01
```

Here we've used `lenstronomy`'s "SHEAR" model and specified the necessary parameters for it to work. 
There is one more attribute of the `GALAXY` species you can specify, though I will save this for later (it is the `SPECIAL` attribute).

To specify `GALAXY` objects with different properties, just create an entry in the SPECIES section. Since we will want to do some lensing eventually, lets create another galaxy that will act the light that is actually being lensed.
Fittingly, we might choose to name this `GALAXY` object "SOURCE".
The SPECIES section would then look like this

```
SPECIES:
    GALAXY_1:
        NAME: LENS
        LIGHT_PROFILE_1:

                center_y: 0.0
        SHEAR_PROFILE_1:

                gamma2: 0.01
    GALAXY_2:
        NAME: SOURCE
        LIGHT_PROFILE_1:
            NAME: SERSIC_ELLIPSE
            PARAMETERS:
                magnitude: 21.5
                center_x: 0.0
                center_y: 0.0
                R_sersic: 6
                n_sersic: 5
                e1: 0.2
                e2: -0.1 
        SHEAR_PROFILE_1:
            NAME: SHEAR
            PARAMETERS:
                gamma1: 0.08
                gamma2: 0.01               
```

Since we'll be using this galaxy as the so-called source in our lensing system, we don't need to worry about specifying a mass profile.
We have also given it the same shear profile as the lens, since they will be part of the same system.
In practice, it is more straightforward to use the `SPECIAL` keyword to connect properties of different objects, but we'll cover that later.

While the `GALAXY` objects will perhaps require the most thought when constructing the config file, the `POINTSOURCE` and `NOISE` objects will be much more straightforward.

**POINTSOURCE.**
This object will allow you to add a point-like light source to the images.
You may wish to utilize this feature to include foreground stars, to make a galaxy look like an AGN, or to include a supernova or other transient in the image.
I'll show all three of those possibilities here.

Let's start with an AGN.
In similar fashion to the way we specified the different `GALAXY` objects, we'll describe a point source object as follows:

```
<Still inside SPECIES section>
    POINTSOURCE_1:
        NAME: AGN
        HOST: SOURCE
        PARAMETERS:
            magnitude: 16
```
Each `POINTSOURCE` object is characterized by a `NAME`, a `HOST`, and `magnitude` and `sep` parameters. The `NAME` attribute will be used to track all properties of this object, so make sure all names are unique. 
The `HOST` attribute will tell `deeplenstronomy` where your object will be in the image. 

The additional parameters determine how the `POINTSOURCE` will appear.
The `sep` parameter will specify how far (in arcseconds) to distance the `POINTSOURCE` from its host.
If this parameter is not specified, the `POINTSOURCE` will be placed exactly on the center of the `HOST`.
In this case, we have selected to place this point source on the center of the `GALAXY` object that we named "SOURCE".
Lastly, the magnitude is the apparent magnitude of the point source.

If we wanted, we could also add a supernova-like point source by specifying a nonzero `sep` parameter. The config entry would then look like this:

```
<Still inside SPECIES section>
    POINTSOURCE_2:
        NAME: SUPERNOVA
        HOST: SOURCE
        PARAMETERS:
            magnitude: 21.0
            sep: 2.0
```
Specifying this second `POINTSOURCE` for the `GALAXY` we named "SOURCE" **will not** by itself put both `POINTSOURCES` in "SOURCE" at the same time.
That aspect is not determined until the `GEOMETRY` section of the config file.
Here, you are just preparing `deeplenstronomy` to put your `POINTSOURCE`s in "SOURCE" later on.

The final type way you may choose to use the `POINTSOURCE` object is to include foreground stars. This is done by setting the `HOST` keyword to 'Foreground' as follows:

```
<Still inside SPECIES section>
    POINTSOURCE_3:
        NAME: STAR
        HOST: Foreground
        PARAMETERS:
            magnitude 14.0
```
This setting will place the point source randomly in your image, and it will not contribute to or be affected by any of the lensing calculations.

**NOISE.**
The final type of object that `deeplenstronomy` allows you to include in your images is the `NOISE` object.
Currently, only `POISSON_NOISE` is built in to `deeplenstronomy`, but other types of noise are on the way.
If you would like a specific type of noise, just ping me and I'll make it happen.

You can define a `NOISE` species like this:

```
<Still inside SPECIES section>
    NOISE_1:
        NAME: POISSON_NOISE
        PARAMETERS:
            mean: 2.0
```
In this implementation, each pixel in the image will have a noise value added to it, and that noise value will be drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean 2.0.
The values assigned to different pixels are assumed to be independent.

### Summary of the SPECIES Section

That certainly was a lot of material.
The `SPECIES` section carries all the properties of all the objects in your entire dataset, so it is important to create it with care.
To summarize this component of the config file, let's look at the `SEPCIES` section in our example as a whole.

```

        NAME: POISSON_NOISE
        PARAMETERS:
            mean: 2.0
```
In making the dataset, this is the collection of objects you will have at your disposal. 
We've created two different `GALAXY`s, three different `POINTSOURCE`s, and a single `NOISE` source. 
Now we'll see how to specify the geometry of the systems that these objects will constitute.

### The GEOMETRY Section
This is the final section in the config file, and will contain information about the relative orientations of the objects in the `SPECIES` section.
The geometry section is organized by the user specifying different `CONFIGURATION`s, which will follow the same indexing rules as the objects in the `SPECIES` section.

Each configuration will have a `NAME`, a `FRACTION`, and then informataion about the physical systems. 
The `NAME` will be used to track the association of properties within `deeplenstronomy`. 
The `FRACTION` is how much of the dataset you would like to be in the specific configuration.
Internally, `deeplenstronomy` just multiplies the `FRACTION` by the `SIZE` in the `DATASET` section to obtain a number of images to simulate, so it is not necessary that the `FRACTION` values across your `CONFIGURATION`s sum to one.

Next, you will defind the `PLANE`s in your physical systems. Let's look at an example to work through this.

```
GEOMETRY:
    CONFIGURATION_1:
        NAME: GALAXY_AGN
        FRACTION: 0.25
        PLANE_1:
            OBJECT_1: LENS
            PARAMETERS:
                REDSHIFT: 0.2                    
        PLANE_2:
            OBJECT_1: SOURCE
            OBJECT_2: AGN
            PARAMETERS:
                REDSHIFT: 0.7                  
        NOISE_SOURCE_1: POISSON_NOISE
```                   

After the `NAME` and `FRACTION` attributes, we can see a `PLANE_1` and a `PLANE_2` have been defined. 
`PLANE`s require you to list the objects you want in the plane and to define the redshift as a parameter.

Here, we've chosen to put a single object in `PLANE_1`, which is the plane closest to Earth. 
We've specified which `SPECIES` to serve as `OBJECT_1` by using the name "LENS", which recall was the name of `GALAXY_1` in the `SPECIES` section.
We've also set this plane to have a redshift of 0.2.

In `PLANE_2`, we've place two objects: "SOURCE" which refers to `GALAXY_2` and "AGN" which refers to `POINTSOURCE_1`. 
We've set this plane to have redshift 0.7 so that it will be behind the objects in `PLANE_1`.

Lastly, we specify that we want to simulate noise on top of the image by specifying a single noise source: `NOISE_SOURCE_1`.
We tell `deeplenstronomy` that we want "POISSON\_NOISE" to be used which will reference `NOISE_1` in the `SPECIES` section since it was named "POISSON\_NOISE".

Now. 
That seems like a lot, but let's say you also want to simulate a set of images with no noise to evaluate the performance of some neural network on high quality images. 
All you need to change to the config file is to add another configuration:

```
<Still inside GEOMETRY section>
    CONFIGURATION_2:
        NAME: GALAXY_AGN_NOISELESS
        FRACTION: 0.25
        PLANE_1:
            OBJECT_1: LENS
            PARAMETERS:
                REDSHIFT: 0.2                    
        PLANE_2:
            OBJECT_1: SOURCE
            OBJECT_2: AGN
            PARAMETERS:
                REDSHIFT: 0.7                  
```

What if we want to simulate lensed supernovae instead of lensed AGN?
Just add another configuration:

```
<Still inside GEOMETRY section>
    CONFIGURATION_3:
        NAME: LENSED_SNE
        FRACTION: 0.25
        PLANE_1:
            OBJECT_1: LENS
            PARAMETERS:
                REDSHIFT: 0.2                    
        PLANE_2:
            OBJECT_1: SOURCE
            OBJECT_2: SUPERNOVA
            PARAMETERS:
                REDSHIFT: 0.7      
        NOISE_SOURCE_1: POISSON_NOISE        
```

What if you're looking to add some spice to your life, and you want to include in this dataset a double source plane system, with a supernova and AGN in the source galaxy, two foreground stars, and Poisson noise?
Just add another configuration:

```
<Still inside GEOMETRY section>
    CONFIGURATION_4:
        NAME: SPICY_LIFE
        FRACTION: 0.25
        PLANE_1:
            OBJECT_1: LENS
            OBJECT_2: STAR
            OBJECT_3: STAR
            PARAMETERS:
                REDSHIFT: 0.2                    
        PLANE_2:
            OBJECT_1: LENS
            PARAMETERS:
                REDSHIFT: 0.7
        PLANE_3:
            OBJECT_1: SOURCE
            OBJECT_2: SUPERNOVA
            OBJECT_3: AGN
            PARAMETERS:
                REDSHIFT: 1.3      
        NOISE_SOURCE_1: POISSON_NOISE        
```
Whatever you want to do, the answer will likely be "Just add another configuration."

One of the main ideas behind `deeplenstronomy` is that once you have defined all the properties of the objects, survey, and images, you are free to simulate any physical system you want.

### Summary 
That's the basics of how to organize the main config file. You will need `DATASET`, `COSMOLOGY`, `IMAGE`, `SURVEY`, `SPECIES`, and `GEOMETRY` sections.
These sections make it possible to separate different aspects of the simulation, hopefully in a way that seems logical to astronomers.

Next we'll look at how to draw parameter values from distributions instead of hard-coding fixed values into the main config file.

## Drawing from Probability Distributions

It doesn't do much good to have to specify all the light profile, mass profile, redshift, survey (and many more) parameters directly in the config file. 
You can, but often you will want to draw those parameters from a probability distribution. 
This action is communicated to `deeplenstronomy` by using the `DISTRIBUTION` keyword in place of the actual parameter value.

As an example, maybe you want to have a range of magnitudes for an object.
Furthermore, let's say you want this range to be a uniform distribution from 16.0 to 23.0.
In the main config file, replace

```
magnitude: 20.0
```

with

```
magnitude:
    DISTRIBUTION:
        NAME: uniform
        PARAMETERS:
            minimum: 16.0
            maximum: 23.0
```

and `deeplenstronomy` will do the rest.
This approach will work for any parameter.

**Available Distributions**

The name "uniform" targets a specific function `uniform()` in the file `deeplenstronomy/distributions.py`.
This file contains several distributions that can also be utilized by specifying their name. 
You are welcome to dig around in there or see the [distribution documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). This page isn't written yet, but will be soon.

## Forcing Correlations

Sometimes, you may want to incorporate correlations between that are drawn from probability distributions.
Perhaps you would like galaxies with larger `R_sersic` values in their light profile to also be brighter.
Another situation where you may want to correlate parameters is color-dependent quantities.
For example, the expected sky brightness will depend on which band you use.

In `deeplenstronomy`, color-dependence is straightforward since the bands used are passed by default to the distribution being sampled.
Let's look at the function `des_exposure_time()` function in `deeplenstronomy/distributions.py`

```python
def des_exposure_time(bands=''):
    # https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.03181.pdf                                                                                                                                                              
    return [45.0 if b == 'Y' else 90.0 for b in bands.split(',')]
``` 
Here we specify that we want an exposure time of 45.0 seconds if the Y band is used, but an exposure time of 90.0 seconds for all other bands, as was done by the Dark Energy Survey in their data collection. 
To utilize this distribution in the main config file, you would replace

```
exposure_time: 90
```

with

```
exposure_time:
    DISTRIBUTION:
        NAME: des_exposure_time
        PARAMETERS: None
```

Thus, color-dependence can usually be incorporated into your simulation in a similar fashion, directly in the `distributions.py` file.
If there is a particular color dependence you would like implemented in the available distribtuions, just let me know.

Other types of correlations--such as brightness to size, or possibly utilizing the fundamental plane to connect galaxy colors, sizes, and velocity dispersions--require a different implementation.
These correlations are implemented using the `SPECIAL` keyword within the `SPECIES` section of the config file.

For information on all the correlations you can intorduce into your dataset using the `SPECIAL` keyword, check out the [special documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). This page isn't written yet, but will be soon.

## Supplemental Input Files

As you may have noticed by now, this main config file can get pretty long.
To make staying organized when working in this framework a little easier, try out the `INPUT` keyword.

As an example, let's clean up the `SURVEY` section.
This section currently looks like this:

```
SURVEY:
	PARAMETERS:
	    BANDS: g,r,i,z,Y
	    seeing: 0.9
	    magnitude_zero_point: 30.0
	    sky_brightness: 27.5
	    num_exposures: 10
```

Copy the parameters subsection into a new file, which can be named whatever you want, but we'll name the file `survey.yaml`.
The file will look like this:

```
PARAMETERS:
    BANDS: g,r,i,z,Y
    seeing: 0.9
    magnitude_zero_point: 30.0
    sky_brightness: 27.5
    num_exposures: 10
```

Now in the main config file, change the `SURVEY` section to this:

```
SURVEY:
    INPUT: survey.yaml
```

Thus, the `INPUT` keyword will substitue the contents of whatever file it is used on in place of itself.
Hopefully, you will find this tool useful in modularizing and organizing your `deeplenstronomy` workflow.
