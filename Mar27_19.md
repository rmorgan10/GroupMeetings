### Major new / final results from IceCube analysis

Under the most optimum conditions, we estimate it will take O(200) alerts to determine whether CC SNe make up a significant fraction of the mostly unexplained high-energy neutrino flux at the 3 sigma confidence level.

It takes a lot of alerts because supernovae are common enough that we expect roughly one unassociated SNe that looks like it exploded right at the time of the neutrino to be in the DECam field of view during each follow-up, and we only expect to detect the neutrino-causing SNe about 5% of the time. So it takes a lot of alerts to observe a statistically significant excess of temporally coincident SNe.
